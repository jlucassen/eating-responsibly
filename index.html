                                <strong>The issues below can each be assigned a "weight"</strong>, or impact score, with higher weights representing greater importance.
                                For ease of comparison, these weights represent the impact of the entire issue.
                                If issue A is given twice the score of issue B, that should mean ridding the world of issue A entirely is twice as good as getting rid of issue B entirely.

                                                <br>
                                                Acidification, specifically "terrestrial acidification", refers to emissions that make soil more acidic, such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).
                                                One example of terrestrial acidification is acid rain, which is when acidifying emissions first enter the atmosphere and then form acids that rain out.
                                                However, acidifying byproducts of agriculture can also leach directly into soil.
                                                These acidifying emissions can also leach into nearby rivers and lakes, affecting those ecosystems as well.

                                                <strong>What's the scale of the issue?</strong>
                                                <br>
                                                Each year, we emit approximately the equivalent of 290 million tons of SO<sub>2</sub>.
                                                Global food production is responsible for about 32% of total acidifying emissions.
                                                Threat of global catastrophe or human extinction seems negligible.
                                                Beyond these basics, the scale is hard to quantify, so individual research and judgement is key.

                                                <br>
                                                Climate change is caused by emissions that trap the heat radiated by the Earth, shifting the balance of heat input/output towards higher temperatures.
                                                This is primarily due to carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), a gas released by burning fossil fuels, as well as many other processes.
                                                There are other emissions that have this effect as well, like methane, nitrous oxide, and synthetic fluorinated gases.
                                                Due to the complexity of Earth's energy systems, this excess heat has many unpredictable effects.

                                                Each year, we emit approximately the equivalent of 52 billion tons of CO<sub>2</sub>.
                                                Global food production is responsible for about 26% of total climate change emissions.
                                                Earth's temperature has increased about 1.5 degrees F (0.8 degrees C) over the past century, and is currently projected to rise 2.5-9 F (1.4-5 C) over the next century.
                                                Sea levels have risen about 8.4 inches (21 cm) since 1880, and are projected to rise 7-23 in (18-58 cm) over the next century.
                                                Other impacts are also projected to worsen, but the numbers are harder to specify precisely due to model variation.
                                                Threat of global catastrophe or human extinction seems non-negligible, but varies widely between models.

                                                Eutrophication is caused by emissions that dramatically increase the rate of algae growth in bodies of water.
                                                This causes "algae blooms", regions in which algae grows so fast it uses up all available oxygen and no other aquatic life can survive.
                                                This is primarily due to runoff containing nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>) and phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) ions.

                                                Global food production is responsible for about 78% of total eutrophying emissions.
                                                Damage from eutrophication in the U.S. alone is estimated to cost about $2.2 billion per year.
                                                Low-oxygen zones produced by eutrophication affect more than 245,000 square kilometers in over 400 near-shore systems.

                                                This can put reduce supply of water needed for drinking, washing, or other important functions.
                                                If clean water is not available, unsafe sources are often substituted.

                                                <br>
                                                Each year, the world uses approximately 4 quadrillion liters of fresh water.
                                                Global food production is responsible for 70% of total fresh water withdrawals.
                                                To provide a more useful measure of impact, this consumption is often weighted according to water scarcity.
                                                Global food production is responsible for 90% of scarcity-weighted fresh water withdrawals.
                                                At this level of water stress, at least 1.8 billion people  worldwide drink water contaminated with feces.
                                                Contaminated drinking-water is estimated to cause 502,000 diarrhoeal deaths each year.
                                                By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas.

                                                Milk cows are repeatedly impregnated and separated from their calves.
                                                Calves raised for veal are resticted to crates only slightly larger than their bodies and often restrained, because movement makes their meat less tender.
                                                They are also given nutrient-poor feed deficient in minerals like iron, also for tenderness.
                                                Calves raised for beef are kept in crowded conditions, and fed mostly grains, leading to digestive problems like ulcers.
                                                They are also typically castrated, branded, de-horned, and have their tails cut.

                                                Farmed chickens are raised in cramped conditions under artificial light, and display signs of stress such as fighting and cannibalism.
                                                Egg-laying hens are often kept in "battery cages", which are dirty, about the size of a sheet of paper, and often produce a wide range of health problems.
                                                Hens lay up to 300 eggs per year, a rate which causes a variety of diseases such as osteoporosis, hemhorraging, and fatty liver disease.
                                                Chickens selected for meat production often have deformed legs, weakened immune systems, heart problems, and high rates of disease.

                                                In the process of wild catch, fish can be crushed, frozen, suffocated, bled to death, or killed with explosives.
                                                In farming operations, fish are routinely taken out of water, exposed to harmful chemicals, malnourished, and kept in crowded and dirty water.
                                                Other organisms like crustaceans and cephalopods are subject to similar treatment.

                                                Food production affects the most fish out of any kind of animal, but the true numbers are hard to estimate because reports are often in tons of fish, not in counts of individual organisms.
                                                Every year 37-120 billion fish are farmed.
                                                In addition, 1-3 trillion are caught, but this is largely "bycatch", which are quickly released but can be injured or killed.

                                                All attempts at understanding animal sentience and moral consideration are quite uncertain, at multiple philosophical junctures.

                                                Pregnant pigs are kept in stalls only slightly larger than their own bodies, leading to muscle, bone, joint, and cardiovascular problems.
                                                Piglets are kept in un-ventilated and un-cleaned conditions, without temperature regulation and with high rates of disease.
                                                Pigs display signs of psychological distress such as biting each other, fighting, and struggling when moved between stalls.
                                                To prevent fighting have their teeth and nails clipped, and are also branded and castrated.

                                The numbers displayed in the graph represent the relative impact per kilogram of food.
                                To get these numbers, we have to run through a few calculations starting from our original data.
                                First, we have to find the impact due to a kilogram of food for a specific issue.
                                $$\frac{\text{impact}}{\text{kg food}} = \frac{\text{impact}}{\text{effector}}*\frac{\text{effector}}{\text{kg food}}$$
                                To find out the amount of effector produced per kilogram of food, we use the results of empirical research.
                                These figures include data like the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced per kilogram of soy milk, or the number of hours of cow suffering required per kilogram of beef.
                                To find out how much of an impact there is per quantity of effector, we use user ratings.
                                These figures come from dividing the number of "points" you allocate to an issue by the amount of effector required to produce that issue.
                                For example, if a user rates acidification 100 points of impact and we know we only emit 1000kg of acidifying emissions per year, we know each kg of effector is responsible for 0.1 points of impact.
                                Thus, our formula effectively becomes:
                                $$\frac{\text{impact}}{\text{kg food}} = \frac{\text{your issue impact rating}}{\text{global effector total}}*\frac{\text{effector per kilogram data}}{\text{1 kg food}}$$
                                Since we know all those numbers, we can calculate this!
                                Next, we add up all the impacts across the issues for a given food.
                                This tells us the total impact score for a kilogram of that food.
                                The last step is to normalize the results - in other words, squish it down into the range 0-1.
                                We have the numbers to use this method for Acidification, Climate, Eutrophication, Water, Fish Suffering, and Pig Suffering.
                                <br><br>
                                However, in some cases there are some extra steps we have to perform to get these numbers.
                                Chickens and cows are used to produce multiple goods each, so we have to figure out how much of global total suffering is due to each product.
                                Once we have that, we can just scale against the global chicken/cow population  to figure out the impact weight.
                                While this adds a few extra steps, the methods are all still just multiplication.

                                Meat chickens:
                                $$\frac{\text{impact}}{\text{kg chicken meat}}=\frac{\text{your issue impact rating}}{\text{total global days of suffering}}*\frac{\text{days of suffering}}{\text{meat chicken}}*\frac{\text{meat chickens}}{\text{year}}*\frac{\text{year}}{\text{kg chicken meat}}$$
                                Egg chickens:
                                $$\frac{\text{impact}}{\text{kg eggs}}=\frac{\text{your issue impact rating}}{\text{global total days of suffering}}*\frac{\text{days of suffering}}{\text{egg chickens}}*\frac{\text{egg chicken}}{\text{year}}*\frac{\text{year}}{\text{kg eggs}}$$
                                Meat cows:
                                $$\frac{\text{impact}}{\text{kg beef}}=\frac{\text{your issue impact rating}}{\text{total global days of suffering}}*\frac{\text{days of suffering}}{\text{meat cow}}*\frac{\text{meat cows}}{\text{year}}*\frac{\text{year}}{\text{kg beef}}$$
                                Milk cows:
                                $$\frac{\text{impact}}{\text{kg milk}}=\frac{\text{your issue impact rating}}{\text{total global days of suffering}}*\frac{\text{days of suffering}}{\text{milk cow}}*\frac{\text{milk cows}}{\text{year}}*\frac{\text{year}}{\text{kg milk}}$$
                                Finally, for animal products made from other animal products, we can just straightforwardly multiply:
                                $$\frac{\text{suffering}}{\text{kg secondary product}} = \frac{\text{suffering}}{\text{kg primary product}}*\frac{\text{kg primary product}}{\text{kg secondary product}}$$

                                        The method of determining impacts per kilogram described above is an approximation which assumes impact is linearly related to quantity of effector.
                                        In reality, this is often not the case.
                                        The first kilogram of CO<sub>2</sub> is practically harmless.
                                        As you emit more though, climate change starts to become a serious concern, and each marginal kilogram is more impactful than the last.
                                        Although it's a bit grim, once you reach the quintillionth kilogram, it becomes pretty harmless again - things are already about as bad as they can get.
                                        In general, impacts seem likely to scale logistically, not linearly.
                                        A linear approximation of marginal impact will usually be inaccurate.
                                        However, since we don't know where in the logistic curve we are, it's a decent estimate.

                                        For the sake of ease of use, several large groups of animals are lumped together.
                                        The conditions of animals in farming operations are quite varied, and there is no sensible way to take an "average" degree of suffering.
                                        The methods above assume that the intensity of suffering of beef/dairy cows, meat/egg chickens, and fish/crusteceans are equivalent.

                                        In the long run, the impacts of food production may be dominated by hard-to-foresee effects on the future.
                                        However, since such effects are hard to anticipate, they only introduce noise into a best guess based on predictable effects.
                                        Such noise seems unlikely to systematically skew the results of an analysis like this, just make the conclusions less confident.

                                        Impacts per kilogram are not a very intuitive measure of how impactful a given food is, since people don't tend to consume equal masses of different foods.
                                        A typical serving of nuts, for example, may be far less massive than a typical serving of meat or vegetables.
                                        However, other measures (impact per calorie, impact per gram protein, impact per serving) are not clearly better, since they can also be quite hard to interpret.
